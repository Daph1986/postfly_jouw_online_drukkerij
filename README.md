POSTFLY is a site where you can order all your necessary printed matter online.
[POSTFLY](http://www.postfly.nl/) already has an existing site, but it needs an update.
The existing site as it is now no longer meets the needs of customers and employees. This is a first draft for the company's new site and in this case is for educational purposes only.

The focus with this site is to combine knowledge about everything conserning printed matter with what was learned during the Code Institute course.
The site's goal is to have a more efficient system for employees and a easy to understand order system for B2B customers.

:busts_in_silhouette: UX
======

This is meant to be a B2B site which targets visitors who are in need of printed matter, such as flyers, folders, posters, business cards, brochures, etc.

### User stories

##### User Goals

- As a user I want to see a clear overview of the possibilities, what can I order. (All products page / Menu -> products)
- As a user I want to see in advance what the costs will be and when it can be delivered. (Product page)
- As a user I want to be able to ask questions if something is not clear. (Contact form)
- As a user I want to be able to ask for a quotation if a product is not on the site, but maybe in the collection. (Quatation form)
- As a user I want to be able to see the different kinds of paper. (Sample kit form)
- As a user I want to be able to go through the ordering process in a simple way. (Shopping bag / Checkout)
- As a user I want to be able to upload my own artwork. (Checkout)
- As a user I want to have easy acces to my cart, and to be able to delete products that are in the cart, as long as the order isn't put through yet. (Shopping cart)
- As a user I want to receive a clear order confirmation with a description of what I ordered. (Confirmation email)
- As a user I want to be able to see a secured overview of my order history. (Dashboard)
- As a user I want to have my details filled out in advance, but also be able to change them if needed. (Profile)
- As a user I want to be able to choose the language. (Dutch or English)

##### Site Owners Goals

- As an employee I want to be able to see a clear overview of the order placed by the customer. (Admin dashboard / Admin order details)
- As an employee I want to be able to change the status of an order (Admin order details)
- As an employee I want to be able to updated or delete products of the site. (Admin)
- As an employee I want to be able to download the artwork that was uploaded. (Admin order details)

### Strategy

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily order their printed matter.

### Scope

For customers, the site should be an improvement over the existing site. Frequently heard complaints with the existing site include that it is not clear where the artwork should be uploaded and that the payment system is not working.
If this can be done, it will also ease the workload of the employees, by solving many complaints and questions related to the site.

### Structure

The site will be structured as clear as possible, with a logic workflow and it should be easy to navigate the site on all screen sizes. 

### Skeleton

The skeleton section is a bit more extensive, for that reason please view this separate [file](readme/skeleton/README.md).

### Fonts and icons

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the Poppins font in the code. Poppins was chosen because this has a good readability and fits the company's identity.
[FFONTS](https://www.ffonts.net/Syntha-Regular.font.download) was used to get the Syntha Regular font for the subtext of the logo.
For the icons [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used.
