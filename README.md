POSTFLY is a site where you can order all your necessary printed matter online.
[POSTFLY](http://www.postfly.nl/) already has an existing site, but it needs an update.
The existing site as it is now no longer meets the needs of customers and employees. This is a first draft for the company's new site and in this case is for educational purposes only. For this reason only a few of the many products are used on this site.

The focus with this site is to combine knowledge about everything conserning printed matter with what was learned during the Code Institute course.
The site's goal is to have a more efficient system for employees and a easy to understand order system for B2B customers.

:busts_in_silhouette: UX
======

This is meant to be a B2B site which targets visitors who are in need of printed matter, such as flyers, posters, business cards, etc.

### User stories

<img src="readme/general/user_stories.png" alt="User stories" width="100%" height="100%"><br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">üîù</a></div>

### Strategy

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily order their printed matter.

### Scope

For customers, the site should be an improvement over the existing site. Frequently heard complaints with the existing site include that it is not clear where the artwork should be uploaded and that the payment system is not working.
If this can be done, it will also ease the workload of the employees, by solving many complaints and questions related to the site.
The site shows a homepage with links to different parts of the site. It contains a products page where the different products are displayed. There is a files section which gives guidance on how to prepare your digital files and a frequently asked question page for the answers to most asked questions. Furthermore there is a section "About us" which gives a bit of background information about the company and there is a contact section where a contact form can be used, a sample kit request form and a quotation form can be filled out.
The site also contains a register page, a log in page and a shopping cart which will color red and update the price when there is a product in the cart.
The register link will dissapear when logged in and the login link will change to account, where the dashboard, profile and logout link will be displayed. When you are a logged in admin there will also be a product management link.

### Structure

The site will be structured as clear as possible, with a logic workflow and it should be easy to navigate the site on all screen sizes. 

### Skeleton

The skeleton section is a bit more extensive, for that reason please view this separate [file](readme/skeleton/README.md).

### Fonts and icons

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the Poppins font in the code. Poppins was chosen because this has a good readability and fits the company's identity.
[FFONTS](https://www.ffonts.net/Syntha-Regular.font.download) was used to get the Syntha Regular font for the subtext of the logo.
For the icons [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used.

### Features for the future

### Content
Most content has been written by me, the technical stories regarding the delivery of the files and the origin of the printing company come from the sites of [POSTFLY](http://www.postfly.nl/) and [Grafische Groep Matthys](https://www.groepmatthys.com/) and were sometimes adjusted by me. Prices are based on the product price from the original site, and adjusted here and there, but are for learning purposes only for this project. No rights can therefore be derived from this.
