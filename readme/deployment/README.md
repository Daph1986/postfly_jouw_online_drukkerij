<img src="../deployment/run_local_1.png" alt="Run local 1" width="75%" height="50%"/> <br>
6. Copy the URL.
7. Open VScode or your preferred IDE,(in this example we are using VScode), open the file or folder in which you want to use the project and open a CLI terminal.
8. Put the following command in the CLI terminal:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Daph1986/postfly_jouw_online_drukkerij.git
```
9. Press enter, and the clone will be created.
10. Set up a virtual environment with these commands in the terminal session:
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```
>If you already have virtualenv installed from a different project, then this step is not needed. The pip command may differ per system this can be pip or pip3.
```
virtualenv env
```
>The needed command may differ to the IDE you are using, such as ```python -m .venv venv ...``` or ```py manage.py ...

Activate the .env with the command:
```
env\Scripts\activate
```
>This command may differ depending on your operating system, please check the Python documentation on creating an ENV.
11. Install all required django modules with the command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
12. Create a new env.py file at the base directory level and copy the following into the created env.py file:
```
import os

#Django
os.environ.setdefault( 'DEVELOPMENT', 'True')
os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', 'your_value')

#Stripe
os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', 'your_value')
os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'your_value')
```
Replace `your_value` with the values from your own created accounts for stripe and a [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/):
- [STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
- [STRIPE_SECRET_KEY](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
- [SECRET_KEY](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)
13. Set up your database by running the following command in your terminal:
```
python3 manage.py make migrations
```
Followed by:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
14. Now create a superuser to get access to the Django admin, use the following command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
15. Now we need to add the required data into the database in the following order by using the following commands:
```
python3 manage.py loaddata categories
python3 manage.py loaddata printingmethod
python3 manage.py loaddata size
python3 manage.py loaddata producttag
python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
16. Now you can start your server with the following command:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
If everything went correctly you should see something like this in the terminal:<br>
<img src="../deployment/running_server.png" alt="Run local 1" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>

### Heroku
To create a live version of the website VSCode was used together with Heroku. This section assumes you have succeeded at running the application in your local environment first, as described above. 
To deploy the website with Heroku the following steps were made:
1. Log in or create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and create a new app by clicking the button.<br>
<img src="../deployment/heroku_deployment_1.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 1" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>
2. Give the app a unique name in all lowercase letters and set `Choose a region` to the one nearest to you (in this case Europ and 
postfly_jouw_online_drukkerij is already taken so think of another name), click on create app.<br>
<img src="../deployment/heroku_deployment_2.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 2" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>
3. On your app dashboard click `Deploy` and select `GitHub`, connect it to your GitHub respository. Don't click `Enable Automatic Deploys` yet.<br>
<img src="../deployment/heroku_connection_github.png" alt="Heroku connection to GitHub" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>
4. Click on the `Resources` tab and type Heroku Postgres in the `Add-ons` field, select the `Hobby Dev` option.
<img src="../deployment/heroku_deployment_3.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 3" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>
5. Click on `Settings` and then `Reveal Config Vars`. <br>
<img src="../deployment/heroku_deployment_4.png" alt="Deployment to Heroku 4" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>
6. Fill in the values from your `env.py` file in your Heroku confic vars: <br>

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
DATABASE_URL | `your_DATABASE_URL`
SECRET_KEY | `your_SECRET_KEY`
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `your_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `your_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

The DATABASE_URL link which can be found in Heroku's Config Vars.
7. Since the database on Heroku is created you need to adjust your `env.py` file, add:
```
os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', '<your postgres url grabbed from Heroku comes here>')
```
>Make sure not to share this link with anybody.
8. Now we need to migrate the new database connection with:
```
python3 manage.py make migrations
```
Followed by:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
>Do not forget to reactivate your virtual environment if the system or IDE is rebooted.
9. Now create a superuser to get access to the Django admin, use the following command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
10. Now we need to add the required data into the database in the following order by using the following commands:
```
python3 manage.py loaddata categories
python3 manage.py loaddata printingmethod
python3 manage.py loaddata size
python3 manage.py loaddata producttag
python3 manage.py loaddata products
```
11. Install Heroku in the terminal, if you don't have that 
yet see how to do that [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and log in with the command: 
```
heroku login
```
12. Then use the command:
```
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app postfly-jouw-online-drukkerij
```
so that Heroku will not try to collect static during deployment.

13. After everything is set up as it should use the following commands to push to GitHub and Heroku:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Place your own commit message here"
git push
heroku git: remote -a your heroku git url
git push heroku main
```
You will then see something like this in your terminal:
<img src="../deployment/pushing_to_heroku.png" alt="Pushing to Heroku" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>

14. If you want you can let the deployment to Heroku be automatically everytime you push to GitHub, on your app dashboard click `Deploy` and click `Enable Automatic Deploys`.
If you go to the `Activity` tab on your app dashboard you can see that there is a build in progress, the details will look a bit like this:
<img src="../deployment/build_finished.png" alt="Heroku build finished" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>
Your app is running on Heroku now.

15. Log in to the admin panel by placing /admin behind your app name, for example for this one: https://postfly-jouw-online-drukkerij.herokuapp.com/admin
Using the superuser log in details log in.

>!!! If you don't see your email address you may need to attempt to log in first to force allauth to create it !!!

Go to `Email addresses` underneath `ACCOUNTS`, and mark `Primary` and `Verified` for the superuser email address, save the changes you made.

16. Create a new webhook endpoint on the Stripe dashboard. <br>
<img src="../deployment/stripe_webhook.png" alt="Stripe wenhook endpoint" width="75%" height="75%"/> <br>

17. Reveal your webhooks siging secret and add it to the Heroku Confic Vars:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `your_STRIPE_WH_SECRET`

#### Connecting AWS to Django

This section assumes you have succeeded at running this application in your local environment first, deployed it to Heroku and set up AWS as described above.

1. Remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from your `Config Vars` on Heroku and add these values to it:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `your_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `your_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
USE_AWS | True

The values you'll find in the downloaded csv file.
Next time you deploy to Heroku, AWS will retrieve your static files and store them.

2. Go to S3, where you'll find a `static` folder with all your static files in it.
3. Click on `Create folder` and name it `media` click save and inside the media folder click `Upload`.
4. Click `Add files` and select the images that go with your products or in this case with the size.
5. Click next and under `Manage public permissions`, and choose `Grant public-read access`.
6. Then click`Upload`, you will see your files being uploaded.<br>
