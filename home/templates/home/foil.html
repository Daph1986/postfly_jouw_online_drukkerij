        <p class="px-4 px-md-0 mt-3">
          Cold foil makes it possible to provide the printing sheets with metallic effects 
          in a single printing run by means of real foil as a spot – so locally – applied.

        <p class="px-4 px-md-0">
          The adhesive layer is applied to the first printing tower. 
          Using a standard printing plate, the adhesive layer is printed on the paper exactly where the foil should go. 
          At the second printing tower, the printing sheet is pressed against the foil. 
          The foil attaches itself sharply and 100% permanently to the adhesive layer. 
          The contactless sheet transport with aerodynamic air tracks guarantees a scratch and blemish-free print production. 
          Due to the very accurate fit, the data for the foil can be formatted as data for an additional PMS color. 
          The CMYK color printing starts from the third printing tower. 
          The entire sheet can now be printed in full color: both the unprinted and the metallized part. 
          A dispersion varnish is applied as a protective layer.
