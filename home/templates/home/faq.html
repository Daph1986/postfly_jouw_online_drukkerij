                <h6>What is resolution?</h6>
                <p>
                  Resolution equals the quality of the image. 
                  Resolution is expressed in dpi (dots per inch). 
                  The higher the number of “dots” per inch, the sharper and higher the quality of the image. 
                  In order to be able to deliver a good quality of printed matter, we need a file with a resolution of 300 dpi. 
                  If the resolution is too low, you will get a blurry or jagged (block effect) result.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For more information on resolution, see "Files" in the menu bar and take a look at the topic about
